## Equivalent to Adobe Flash Pro
Although Adobe has stated that it is not a direct replacement for Flash, Adobe Edge offers most of the design features available in Adobe Flash Professional.

Adobe Edge allows you to add animations to HTML documents and add CSS styles to SVG, PNG, JPG and GIF files. Edge is based on the WebKit rendering engine and takes full advantage of the latest web development standards as Adobe seek to find a solution to Flash related issues across platforms and manufacturers such as the banning of Flash by Apple on iPhones.

### Well organized, slick timeline editor
Adobe Edge allows you to easily choreograph animations with a slick timeline editor. This includes the ability to animate position, size, color, shape, rotation and more at the property level. You can also both copy and paste transitions, invert them, and choose from over 25 built-in easing effects for added creativity.

### A Flash killer?
Adobe Edge could one day replace Flash as the standard for multimedia content on the web. Download this fully functioning free preview and see for yourself.

You can also copy and paste SVG artwork from Illustrator and there are additional Hand and Zoom tools.
